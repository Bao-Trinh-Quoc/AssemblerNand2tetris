This will be a two staged process.

First I wll write basic assembler that can translate program into machine code without symbols

We need to parsing each line of the program first

# Note: Remember to add makefile and .gitignore later

There is something called bit-field in C 

Implement a function that can parse a line of code.
First tho, needed to implement a function to "clean" the line of code

Pretty challanging bcs I got to read and refined the code

EHHHH, somehow I got the code to work. I can now parse the line of code and get the opcode and operands
Implemented parseCType and cleanLine and tested it

Modifed the code to more error-proof
