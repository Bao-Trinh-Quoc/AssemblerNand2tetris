This will be a two staged process.

First I wll write basic assembler that can translate program into machine code without symbols

We need to parsing each line of the program first

# Note: Remember to add makefile and .gitignore later

There is something called bit-field in C 

Implement a function that can parse a line of code.
First tho, needed to implement a function to "clean" the line of code
